                                <p> Overall my exploration of jQuery went very well. I had very little experience with using jQuery or jQuery UI elements so I was able to
                                    take some time and implement a few of the elements that are demoed on the jQuery UI website. Creating the HTML portion of the elements
                                    fairly easy and straight forward but this exploration helped me gain a better understanding of jQuery functions and the syntax. I
                                    decided to explore the jQuery UI button, dialog, accordion and slider element. I decided on the button element because it is a common
                                    component of almost any website today. Creating the jQuery button is, initially, the same as creating a button in HTML. In order to apply
                                    jQuery UI functionality/theming to the button just requires the declaring of a jQuery function using the buttons ID and the jQuery button
                                    function. Creating a jQuery UI dialog was simply creating a div and giving it an id of dialog and creating a jQuery function for this div
                                    with no internal functionality outside of its declaration. JQuery UI dialogs serve as a form of alerting the user so I added in the animated
                                    capability to make it more practical. To do this I turned the autoOpen property to off within the jQuery function for the dialog and
                                    then declared the properties "show" and "hide" with effects. The "show" and "hide" properties tell the dialog what to do when it is opened
                                    or closed. Since the dialog now starts as closed, I had to create a functionality for activating the dialog. To do this I added the click
                                    function to the button previously created and inside the click function I gave it the functionality to open the dialog. The accordion
                                    is similar to the dialog element in the fact that it requires creating a div and giving it an ID of "accordion". However to create the tabs
                                    of the accordion the div had to contain and header within to represent the tabs. By default an accordion element will have the first tab
                                    opened, each tab will be the same size and the tabs could not be closed. So because of personal preference, within the jQuery function for
                                    the accordion I changed the "collapsible" property to "true" which allowed for the ability to close the tabs of the accordion. By setting
                                    the "heightStyle" property equal to "content" it tells the accordion to make the tabs size to the content it contains. Lastly, setting the
                                    "active" property to false will have the accordion default to all its tabs being closed. I explored the slider element with the intention
                                    of seeing if it was possible to add another jQuery UI element with the accordion rather than the intention of learning more about the
                                    slider element. As it can be seen, adding the slider element within the accordion invovled the same process as adding in a jQuery element
                                    outside of the accordion.
